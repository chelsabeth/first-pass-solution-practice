# Naive
    # a simple solution that does not make any attempt to optimize performace or memory usage
# Brute-force
    # try all possible solutions to find the best one
# Greedy
    # at one or more points, this algorithm makes the "best" choice, similar to what a person might do

'''
The idea is that we have a knapsack with 
a size or weight limit that contraints
how many things we can put inside

We have lots of items we want to put into 
the knapsack. However, they won't all fit.
Choosing the optimal combination of items 
that meets size or weight contraints while
maximizing value might seem doable with a 
small example, but this becomes a difficult 
problem very quickly

# Naive Solution
# sort items by value - highest valued item first
# put most valuable items in knapsack until full
# return knapsack



# Brute-force Solution
# go through list of items and make new list with all possible combos of items
# go through each combination and return the combo with the highest value 



# Greedy Solution
# calculate efficiency of each item
# now sort by eddiciency and add the most efficient items first
